# ContextVault — Session Handoff

- **Last updated:** 2026-07-23 20:11 EEST (persisted conversations + gap rejection merged #114; fixes PR #115 open)
- **Updated by:** Claude (Opus 4.8) with GoodGlor
- **Board (source of truth for *what to do*):** GitHub Projects "ContextVault" (`GoodGlor`, project #1). Cards = issues in `GoodGlor/ContextVault`. *(This session's work shipped outside the board via superpowers SDD.)*

---

## TL;DR

ContextVault is a full-stack, admin-curated RAG assistant (FastAPI + Postgres/pgvector
backend, React/Vite SPA), feature-complete.

**Merged this session — Persisted conversations + admin knowledge-gap rejection — #114 (squash
`3ec75c6`).** Two features:
- **Persisted conversations.** The query-page chat is now saved server-side per `(user, repo)`
  in new `conversations` + `conversation_turns` tables (each turn stores the answer plus JSONB
  snapshots of its citations/sources). `POST /query` loads history **from the DB**
  (server-authoritative — the client no longer sends `history`) and appends each turn. New
  `GET`/`DELETE /repositories/{id}/conversation` restore/clear the thread; the query page
  hydrates on load and has a **Clear conversation** button.
- **Admin gap rejection.** New `gap_rejections` table; an admin can **reject** a knowledge gap
  with a **required reason** (`POST .../knowledge-gaps/reject`); rejected questions drop out of
  the active gap list; `GET .../knowledge-gaps/rejected` lists them. Admin UI: Reject button +
  reason + a Rejected-gaps section.
- **Bug fixed along the way:** reloading with a valid session logged the user out (`AuthProvider`
  wired the API client in a `useEffect`, so a child's mount-time request raced ahead of it →
  unauthenticated → 401 → session cleared). This silently broke reload-restore; fixed by wiring
  the client synchronously. Verified: backend **389✓**, frontend **74✓**, CI green on #114.

**In flight — PR #115 (`fix/admin-note-title-and-creator-grant`), CI running at handoff.** Two
fixes found while the owner tested the running app:
1. **Admin-note grounding.** A note answering a gap is *titled* with the question and holds only
   the answer in `content`; ingestion embedded only the content, so a terse note (title "яка
   погода в києві", content "10 градусів") was chunked as a bare "10 градусів" — retrieval found
   it (top_score 0.71) but the LLM couldn't ground it and refused. Fix: ingest `title\n\ncontent`.
2. **Auto-grant repo creator.** `POST /repositories` discarded the creating admin; now grants
   them access on creation. (TDD caught a real bug: `repo.id` is `None` until flush — the UUID PK
   default is applied on flush, not at construction — so the first version inserted a NULL
   `repository_id`; fixed with a `flush` before granting.) Verified locally: backend **391✓**,
   ruff/format/mypy clean; RED confirmed before each fix.

**⚠️ Owner action — rotate exposed secrets.** A screenshot shared this session exposed the live
`.env`: `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, and `ENCRYPTION_KEY`. Rotate all three.
Rotating `ENCRYPTION_KEY` invalidates the provider keys stored encrypted in `provider_settings`
— re-enter them in the Providers tab afterward.

**Owner note (from #112, still applies to existing data):** old bge-m3 vectors are incompatible
with Gemini's embedding space — `TRUNCATE chunks;` + re-ingest before trusting retrieval on a
pre-Gemini DB, and set a verified Gemini provider key or every ingest/query 409s.

## Done recently (this session)

### Persisted conversations + admin gap rejection — merged as #114 (squash `3ec75c6`; superpowers SDD, 12 tasks)

Built spec → plan → subagent-driven TDD (per-task review + final whole-branch review on the
strongest model). Specs/plans under `docs/superpowers/`.
- **Part 1 — conversations:** `Conversation`/`ConversationTurn` models + migration
  `f170138d3652`; `services/conversations.py` (get-or-create, append_turn with monotonic
  ordinal, `recent_history` oldest-first tail, clear); `POST /query` server-authoritative
  history + turn persistence (the `history` request field removed); `api/conversations.py`
  GET/DELETE (owner-scoped, active-grant gated); `QueryPage` hydrate-on-load + Clear button.
- **Part 2 — gap rejection:** `GapRejection` model + migration `f333a95e2154`;
  `services/knowledge_gaps.py` gains `reject_gap` (upsert on `(repo, normalized_question)`),
  `list_rejected_gaps`, and an exclusion filter in `list_knowledge_gaps`; `api/knowledge_gaps.py`
  POST-reject (422 empty reason, admin-only) + GET-rejected; admin UI Reject flow + Rejected-gaps
  section; EN/UK i18n.
- **Auth reload-logout fix:** `AuthProvider` now wires `configureApi` synchronously in render
  (ref-guarded once), not in a `useEffect` — child mount-time requests no longer race the wiring.
  Regression test reproduces the child-before-parent effect order.
- **Final-review fixes folded in:** normalization parity (`_normalize_text` now `.strip(" ")` to
  match SQL `btrim`, so a rejected gap with edge tabs/newlines can't reappear); `listRejectedGaps`
  `.catch` handlers; a not_in_vault turn-persistence/replay test.
- Docs updated (`docs/architecture.md`, `README.md`). Backend 389✓, frontend 74✓.

### Admin-note grounding + auto-grant repo creator — PR #115 (open, `fix/admin-note-title-and-creator-grant`)

See TL;DR. Root-caused against the **live DB** (admin notes ingest fine; queries retrieve them at
top_score 0.71 but the LLM refuses a context-free terse answer). Files:
`api/sources.py` (ingest `title\n\ncontent`), `api/repositories.py` (`flush` + `grant_access` to
creator), plus TDD tests in `test_admin_notes_api.py` / `test_admin_repositories_api.py`.

### Database-backed reports — branch `feat/db-reports` (14 tasks, superpowers SDD; not yet merged)

Branched off `main` at `c6f1e3a` (post #114/#115). Spec → plan under `.superpowers/sdd/`; each
task built TDD (RED confirmed, then GREEN) with its own commit. What shipped:
- **Reporting-DB connections.** `DatabaseConnection` model (Postgres or MySQL, password
  encrypted at rest with the existing `ENCRYPTION_KEY` field-level scheme); a dialect-abstracted
  connector (`services/database.py`) does connection test + read-only schema introspection.
  Admin UI: a **Database** tab to connect, introspect, and edit an allow-list of exposed
  tables/columns (only allow-listed schema is ever shown to the LLM or queryable).
  `PUT`/`PATCH .../database` create/update the connection and its allow-list; introspection is
  admin-only.
- **NL → guardrailed SQL → PDF.** A report is requested in natural language
  (`POST .../reports`) and generated as a background task: `report_llm.py` prompts the
  configured LLM with the allow-listed schema only and demands a strict single-JSON contract
  (SQL + chart spec); `sqlglot`-based guardrails (`services/sql_guardrails.py`) parse and
  validate the single-`SELECT` AST — allow-list-only tables/columns, no schema-qualified names,
  no `pg_`/`lo_`/other privileged function family, no `SELECT INTO`, LIMIT clamped — before
  anything executes; execution runs in a rolled-back read-only transaction with a statement
  timeout (`services/report_execution.py`); on a guardrail or execution failure the orchestrator
  (`services/reports.py`) feeds the error back to the LLM for one self-repair retry before giving
  up. Rendering (`services/report_render.py`) turns the result into a matplotlib chart + a
  Unicode-safe `fpdf2` PDF (so Cyrillic/etc. titles and labels render correctly).
- **Per-user report history + PDF download.** `GeneratedReport` rows are per-requesting-user;
  `GET .../reports` returns the caller's own reports (admin `?all=true` sees everyone's, plus the
  audit-trail `generated_sql`); `GET .../reports/{id}/download` streams the stored PDF bytes;
  owner-or-admin only, 404 (never 403) for someone else's report so existence isn't leaked.
- **Nightly schedules.** A schedule *freezes* an already-`DONE` report's validated SQL + chart
  spec (`ReportSchedule.frozen_sql`/`frozen_chart_spec`); the scheduler
  (`services/report_scheduler.py`, lifespan-only background task) re-executes the frozen SQL
  verbatim at `run_at_time` with **no further LLM call** — cheaper and immune to the LLM changing
  its mind on a re-run. `report-schedules` API: create (freeze), list (own / admin `?all=true`),
  PATCH (toggle `enabled` / change time), delete.
- **Frontend (this task, #14, the final one).** `ReportsPage` — any authenticated user: pick a
  granted repository, request a report, watch it generate (2s poll while
  pending/processing, same idiom as the sources-ingestion poll), download the PDF
  (`URL.createObjectURL` + revoke), see the failure reason inline, and freeze a done report into
  a nightly schedule (prompts for a time) from a Schedules section with an enable/disable toggle
  and delete. `/reports` route + nav link visible to all users (not admin-gated, unlike the
  Database tab). `api/reports.ts` mirrors the two backend routers; `api.getBlob` added to the
  client for the binary PDF download (parallels `apiFetch`'s auth/error handling, can't reuse it
  since it resolves `.blob()` instead of `.json()`). EN/UK i18n complete.
- Backend gate green throughout (477✓ at the end); frontend gate green (93✓, lint/format/
  typecheck/build). **Not merged yet** — still needs a PR + the owner's review before it ships.

*Older completed work (#105–#112 etc.) demoted to History.*

## Next up

1. **Merge PR #115** once its backend CI goes green (frontend already ✓). Owner asked to confirm
   before merge this session; the standing directive is squash-merge after green.
2. **Rotate the three exposed `.env` secrets** (see TL;DR) — owner action. This is also a
   **prerequisite for shipping `feat/db-reports`**: that branch stores reporting-database
   passwords with the same `ENCRYPTION_KEY` field-level scheme as provider keys, so the key must
   be settled (not rotated again) before real connections are created against it, or every stored
   password becomes unreadable on the next rotation.
3. **`feat/db-reports` still needs a PR + merge decision.** Backend gate 477✓, frontend gate 93✓
   locally at handoff; branched off `main` at `c6f1e3a` (before #114 conversations/gap-rejection
   were on `main` at branch time — they already are, so no rebase needed, but re-diff against
   current `main` before opening the PR in case it moved further). Honest gaps before/soon after
   shipping:
   - **MySQL has no CI service and is untested live.** The reporting-DB connector and guardrails
     are dialect-abstracted and unit-tested through that abstraction (mocked/dialect-parameterized
     tests), but no workflow spins up a real MySQL instance — the MySQL path has **never run
     against an actual MySQL server** in this project. Postgres is the only dialect verified
     end-to-end. Treat MySQL as beta until either a CI service is added or someone smoke-tests it
     by hand.
   - **No retention/cleanup of old PDFs.** `GeneratedReport.pdf_data` accumulates forever (bytea in
     Postgres) — no TTL, no size cap, no admin purge tool. A busy nightly schedule will grow the
     table indefinitely; needs a policy (age-based? count-per-schedule?) before nightly schedules
     see real usage.
   - **No per-user row-level data restrictions.** Access control is repository-level (the same
     grant model as the RAG side) — once a user can request reports against a repository's
     connected database, they can ask for anything within the admin's allow-listed
     tables/columns. There is no row-level filtering (e.g. "salesperson X only sees their own
     rows"). Fine for the current trust model (repo-level grants), a real gap if that model
     changes.
   - **No DOCX/PPTX export** — PDF only. Not started; would need its own render path in
     `services/report_render.py` (or a separate module) plus corresponding download plumbing.
4. **Re-tune `retrieval_min_score` for Gemini embeddings (worth a card).** With Gemini, even
   loosely-related chunks score ~0.7, so the current `0.3` threshold (tuned for bge-m3) barely
   filters — the LLM does all the relevance work. Flagged since #112; the "weather" confusion
   above is a symptom. Investigate a higher threshold or a relative/margin cutoff.
5. **Decide the fate of `wip/passage-toggle`** — the parked passage view/hide toggle (frontend,
   green locally last session, never reviewed). Rebase onto current `main`, review, PR or drop.
6. **SSRF DNS-rebinding / TOCTOU hardening** (`services/web_source.py`) — still open from #100.
   `getaddrinfo` validates the host but httpx re-resolves at connect; not pinned to the validated
   IP. Safe as-is (admin-only, redirects re-validated); harden + `/security-review` before
   non-admin exposure. Worth a card.

Minor deferred items from #114's reviews (recorded, non-blocking): GET `/conversation` does a
write-on-read (get-or-create + commit) with an unguarded first-touch insert race; a QueryPage
"clears" test asserts without `waitFor`; no cascade-delete tests. See the SDD ledger under
`.superpowers/sdd/progress.md` (git-ignored scratch) for the full list.

## Open known issues / gotchas

- **UUID primary keys are populated on *flush*, not at construction.** `UUIDPrimaryKeyMixin` uses
  a column `default=uuid.uuid4`, applied at INSERT. If you need a new row's `id` to reference it
  (e.g. create a Grant for a just-created Repository), `await session.flush()` first — else the FK
  column goes in as NULL. (This bit #115; TDD caught it.)
- **Don't query `db_session` directly right after an API call that triggers background ingestion.**
  The admin-note/upload tests run `run_ingestion` against the test session via
  `get_ingestion_session_factory`; a direct `db_session.execute(select(...))` afterward **hangs**.
  Verify through the API instead (e.g. `GET /repositories/{id}/sources/{id}` returns the stored
  passage), like the other tests in `test_admin_notes_api.py`.
- **Stale `.mypy_cache` produces spurious `attr-defined` errors** on `contextvault.services`
  submodule imports (`from contextvault.services import X`). If mypy flags these, `rm -rf
  .mypy_cache && uv run mypy` — a fresh run is authoritative (CI runs fresh).
- **`f"...".encode("utf-8")` trips ruff UP012** (string-literal encode with a redundant arg) even
  though `variable.encode("utf-8")` does not. Use `.encode()`.
- **Conversation history is server-authoritative** — the `/query` request body no longer accepts
  a `history` field. Any client/test still sending it is ignored (harmless), not an error.
- **Frontend tooling versions aligned deliberately:** vitest **3** with vite **6**. Node 25's
  experimental `localStorage` global is non-functional and shadows jsdom's — the in-memory
  `Storage` in `frontend/src/test/setup.ts` stays.
- **`ENCRYPTION_KEY` required** before persisting/using any provider key (`./dev.sh` auto-generates
  one into `.env`; tests get a per-run key from `conftest`).
- **Forced-change enforcement lives in `get_current_user`** — new blockable authenticated
  endpoints should depend on it.
- DB-backed backend tests **skip** (not fail) when Postgres is unreachable; `docker compose up -d`
  + `uv run alembic upgrade head`.
- **e2e is not run by CI** (no Playwright in `.github/workflows`); run manually against `./dev.sh`.
  The `:8000` port can conflict with the owner's other project — run ContextVault with
  `export BACKEND_PORT=8001 VITE_PROXY_TARGET=http://localhost:8001 && ./dev.sh`.

## Working rules & gotchas (project conventions)

- **Verify the FULL CI-parity gate before pushing.** Backend CI runs `ruff check src tests`,
  **`ruff format --check src tests`**, **`mypy`** (bare → includes `tests/`), `alembic upgrade head`,
  `pytest`. Running only `ruff check`/`mypy src` misses format diffs and test-only type errors.
  (`ruff check` ≠ `ruff format --check` — a Task-2 file this session was format-dirty but
  lint-clean; caught before merge.)
- **After committing, confirm `git status --porcelain` is empty** and re-run the gate on the
  committed state before declaring green.
- **Frontend DoD (from `frontend/`):** `npm run lint`, `npm run format:check`, `npm run typecheck`,
  `npm test`, `npm run build`. Node 22. New i18n keys go in **both** `en.json` and `uk.json`.
- **TDD:** RED → GREEN (minimal) → full gate. Update docs in the **same PR** — hard rule.
- **Branch from fresh main:** `git fetch && git checkout main && git pull --ff-only` then
  `git checkout -b <slug>`. PRs are **squash-merged**, so after a merge local `main` may diverge
  from squashed `origin/main` — `git reset --hard origin/main`.
- **Merge policy (owner's standing directive):** open the PR, run the full gate + watch CI green,
  then squash-merge. *(This session the owner asked to confirm before each merge — respect that
  until told otherwise.)*
- Migrations (`migrations/versions/`) are NOT in ruff/mypy scope.
- Commit trailer: `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.8 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>`.

## History

- **This session:** #114 persisted conversations + admin gap rejection (superpowers SDD, 12
  tasks; includes the auth reload-logout fix) — detailed under *Done recently*. PR #115 (admin-note
  grounding + auto-grant creator) in flight.
- **#112** Gemini API embeddings replace the local torch/bge-m3 embedder (removed
  `sentence-transformers`+`torch`; `GeminiEmbeddingProvider`, 1024-dim asymmetric task; verified
  Gemini key now required, 409 otherwise). Motivated by a torch/MPS SIGSEGV that rebooted the
  owner's Mac; also fixed a bulk-upload DB pool-exhaustion bug. Existing data needs
  `TRUNCATE chunks` + re-ingest.
- **#111** Global provider keys (`ProviderSetting` + migration `d4f1a2b7c9e0`, drops per-repo key)
  + LLM-vision OCR (`llm/ocr.py`, replaces RapidOCR; fixes Cyrillic images).
- **#109** LLM config panel redesign (single model dropdown, optional key). **#108** chat e2e.
  **#107** chat with memory (client-held, since made server-authoritative by #114). **#106**
  multi-file upload. **#105** visible model dropdown + green CI + drop dead `*_api_key` fallbacks.
- **#100–#104** image(OCR)/web sources, HEIC support, dynamic model-list endpoint, EN/UK i18n,
  copy-invite-link. Earlier: admin UI epic (#37–#40), frontend foundation (#34–#36), backend core
  (auth, ingestion, retrieval, providers, citations, not_in_vault, invitations, grants, query
  logging, knowledge gaps, analytics, Admin Notes). See `git log` and the board.
