"""Unit tests for invite-token generation and hashing (card #26).

An invite token is a high-entropy secret handed to the invited user once; only
its hash is ever stored, so a leaked database never yields a usable invite. These
tests pin the two guarantees the storage model relies on: the raw token is
unguessable and unique per call, and hashing is deterministic so a presented
token can be matched against the stored digest.
