"""Shared pytest fixtures.

The ``db_session`` fixture yields an ``AsyncSession`` bound to a connection whose
outer transaction is rolled back after each test, so integration tests never
leave data behind. It skips (rather than fails) when no migrated database is
reachable, keeping the pure-unit suite green in environments without Postgres.
