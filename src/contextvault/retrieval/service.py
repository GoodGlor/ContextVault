"""Retrieval service — question in, ranked relevant chunks out.

This is the orchestration layer the RAG loop calls (design spec §4). It embeds
the question with the system-wide provider, runs the access-filtered vector
search (``search_chunks`` — the SQL-level access boundary), then applies a
relevance threshold so the *weak/empty* case is distinguishable from a real hit.
That distinction is what powers the honest "not in this vault" answer and the
knowledge-gap dashboard: ``top_score`` is set whenever any chunk was retrievable
(so a weak-but-present match feeds the gap signal), while ``chunks`` holds only
the matches good enough to answer from.
