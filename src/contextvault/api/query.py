"""The query endpoint — the full RAG loop behind one route (card #19).

`POST /repositories/{id}/query` is where everything built so far meets the user:
authenticate, enforce the repository grant, retrieve the access-filtered chunks,
generate a grounded answer through the configured provider, and return the answer
with its citations resolved to real source documents (design spec §4/§6).

Two access checks stand in front of generation. The repository must exist (404),
and the caller must hold an *active* grant on it (403) — the same predicate the
retrieval query enforces at the SQL level, surfaced here as an explicit,
first-class denial rather than an empty result. Beyond that gate the honest
"not in this vault" behaviour (card #18) carries through untouched: weak or empty
retrieval flows into the provider, which returns the flagged refusal, so the
endpoint never special-cases it.
