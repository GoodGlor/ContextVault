"""User-management endpoints (admin) — account recovery + deletion (design spec §2).

An admin can issue a random temporary password for a user who has lost access
(card #27) or permanently delete a user (card #28). The temp password is returned
to the admin **once**, in plaintext; only its hash is stored, and the user is
forced to replace it on next login (``must_change_password``), so the admin never
learns the user's real password. Deletion is confirmation-gated and preserves
analytics signal by anonymizing (detaching) the user's contributions rather than
erasing them.
