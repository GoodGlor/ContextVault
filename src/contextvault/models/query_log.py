"""QueryLog model — one row per user question (card #30, design spec §5).

Every query is logged: it is the raw material for the knowledge-gap dashboard
(#31) and usage analytics (#33). The row captures who asked (nullable — see below),
against which repository, the question text, the retrieval signal (best similarity
and how many chunks cleared the relevance threshold), whether the answer was
grounded, and — via ``created_at`` — when.

``user_id`` is ``ON DELETE SET NULL`` (nullable): deleting a user (#28) anonymizes
their past questions to "asked by a deleted user" instead of erasing them, so the
analytics signal survives the account (design spec §2). ``repository_id`` cascades:
a repository's history dies with the repository.
