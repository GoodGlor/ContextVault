"""The OpenAI (ChatGPT) ``LLMProvider`` — generation via the OpenAI SDK.

Implements the provider-agnostic ``answer`` contract (card #15) against OpenAI's
Chat Completions API, enforcing the same two defining behaviours as the Anthropic
and Gemini providers:

- **Grounded, numbered-chunk answers.** The retrieved chunks are laid out under
  ``[1..n]`` markers and the system message tells the model to answer *only* from
  them and cite those numbers. The ``[n]`` markers the model emits are parsed back
  into ``Citation`` objects pointing at the exact source span, so the citation
  experience is identical across every provider — no reliance on any vendor-native
  citation feature.
- **Honest "not in this vault".** With no relevant chunks the provider
  short-circuits and returns the honest answer without spending an API call.

The prompt-build / marker-parse machinery is the shared
``contextvault.llm.citations`` scheme (card #17); this provider only wires it to
the OpenAI SDK. The model defaults to ``gpt-4o`` and is configurable (constructor
arg or ``openai_model`` setting), per the card.
