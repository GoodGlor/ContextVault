"""The shared numbered-chunk citation scheme (card #17): prompt → parse → map.

Only Claude offers native citations, so ContextVault builds its own scheme that
works identically across *every* provider. This module is the one place that
machinery lives; the Anthropic, Gemini, and future OpenAI/OpenRouter providers
all import it, so citations behave the same no matter which vendor generated the
answer:

- **prompt** — ``build_user_message`` lays the retrieved chunks out under
  ``[1..n]`` markers, and ``SYSTEM_PROMPT`` tells the model to answer *only* from
  those numbered sources and cite them by number.
- **parse → map** — ``parse_citations`` reads the ``[n]`` markers back out of the
  model's answer and resolves each to the exact source span (document + character
  offsets) it points at, so the UI can jump to and highlight the passage.

``NOT_IN_VAULT`` is the honest answer a provider returns, without an API call,
when retrieval surfaced nothing relevant.
