"""Chunk parsed documents into overlapping, positioned passages.

The ``chunk`` stage of the ingestion pipeline (design spec §7): turn a
``ParsedDocument`` into overlapping ``TextChunk``s sized for retrieval. Each
chunk keeps the exact character span it was sliced from — so a citation can
jump back to the highlighted source passage — plus the source page(s) that span
touches, derived from the document's positioned blocks.

Chunking is character-based in v1: deterministic, tokenizer-free, and the
offsets map straight onto the ``char_start``/``char_end`` a citation needs, with
the invariant ``parsed.text[chunk.char_start:chunk.char_end] == chunk.text``.
Size and overlap are configurable, defaulting to the ``chunk_size`` /
``chunk_overlap`` settings.
