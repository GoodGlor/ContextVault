"""The ``EmbeddingProvider`` abstraction.

Embeddings are pluggable (design spec §7). v1 ships a single local,
multilingual implementation, but the retrieval/ingestion code depends only on
this interface so a paid provider can be swapped in later without touching
callers. The pgvector column dimension is tied to the active model's
``dimension`` — changing models means re-embedding.
