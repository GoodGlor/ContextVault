"""Invitation persistence: issuing invites and redeeming them (card #26).

An admin issues an invitation for a new username; the invited user redeems it by
choosing their own password, which creates the account (design spec §2). The
service owns the two invariants the API relies on: an invite is single-use and
expiring, and the admin never handles the user's password.
