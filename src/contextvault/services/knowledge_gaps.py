"""Knowledge-gap detection (card #31, design spec §5).

A *knowledge gap* is a question the vault could not answer — a logged query whose
answer was the honest "not in this vault" (``not_in_vault = True``: retrieval was
empty or too weak to ground). This service turns those logged gaps into the admin's
curation to-do list for one repository: similar questions are aggregated (case- and
whitespace-insensitive) and ranked so the most-asked, still-uncovered topics rise to
the top — "N users asked about X, no source covers it" (design spec §5.2).

The loop this feeds: user demand (gaps) → admin writes an Admin Note (#32) → the
vault permanently answers it.
