``log_query`` persists one ``QueryLog`` row per answered question. It is called from
the query endpoint after retrieval + generation, capturing the retrieval signal
(``top_score``, ``chunk_count``) and whether the answer was grounded
(``not_in_vault``). Downstream cards read these rows: the knowledge-gap dashboard
(#31) and usage analytics (#33).
